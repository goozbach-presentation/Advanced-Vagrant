Advanced Vagrant
================

Ok, you're running Vagrant, and you have your environment set up 'just so'.

What's next?
How about:

* Keeping logs of all the tasks you do from inside the Vagrant box?
* Setting up and tearing down boxes with Provisioners?
* Defining your vagrant boxes *INSIDE* of your config management?
* Building, hosting, and managing all of your boxes and their various states?
* Automating the building of your Vagrant boxes.
